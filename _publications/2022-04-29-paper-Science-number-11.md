The crystallographic pore sizes of zeolites are substantially smaller than those inferred from catalytic transformation and molecular sieving capabilities, which reflects flexible variation in zeolite opening pores. We imaged the straight channels of ZSM-5 zeolite with benzene as a probe molecule in in situ electron microscopy and observed subcell flexibility of the framework. The opening pores stretched along the longest direction of confined benzene molecules with a maximum aspect change of 15% and the Pnma spacegroup symmetry of the MFI framework caused adjacent channels to deformation. This compensation maintained the stability and rigidity of the overall unit cell within 0.5% deformation. The subcell flexibility originates mainly from the topologic soft Si-O-Si hinges between rigid tetrahedral SiO~4~, with inner angles varying from 135^°^ to 153^°^, confirmed by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations.
