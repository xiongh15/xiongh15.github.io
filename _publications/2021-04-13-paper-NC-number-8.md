The micro-structures of catalyst materials basically affect their macro-architectures and catalytic performances. Atomically resolving the micro-structures of zeolite catalysts, which have been widely used in the methanol conversion, will bring us a deeper insight into their structure-property correlations. However, it is still challenging for the atomic imaging of silicoaluminophosphate zeolites by electron microscopy due to the limits of their electron beam sensitivity. Here, we achieve the real-space imaging of the atomic lattices in SAPO-34 and SAPO-18 zeolites, including the Al–O–P atoms and bonds, by the integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC-STEM). The spatial distribution of SAPO-34 and SAPO-18 domains in SAPO-34/18 intergrowths can be clearly resolved. By changing the Si contents and templates in feed, we obtain two SAPO-34/18 catalysts, hierarchical and sandwich catalysts, with highly-mixed and separated SAPO-34 and SAPO-18 lattices respectively. The reduced diffusion distances of inside products greatly improve the catalytic performances of two catalysts in methanol conversion. Based on the observed distributions of lattices and elements in these catalysts, we can have a preliminary understanding on the correlation between the synthesis conditions and structures of SAPO-34/18 intergrowth catalysts to further modify their performances based on unique architectures.
