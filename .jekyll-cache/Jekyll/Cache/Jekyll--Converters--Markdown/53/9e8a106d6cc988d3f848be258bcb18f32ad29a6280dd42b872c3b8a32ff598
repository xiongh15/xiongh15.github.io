      <p>We seek to completely revise current models of airborne transmission of respiratory viruses by providing never-before-seen atomic-level views of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within a respiratory aerosol. Our work dramatically extends the capabilities of multiscale computational microscopy to address the significant gaps that exist in current experimental methods, which are limited in their ability to interrogate aerosols at the atomic/molecular level and thus ob-scure our understanding of airborne transmission. We demonstrate how our integrated data-driven platform provides a new way of exploring the composition, structure, and dynamics of aerosols and aerosolized viruses, while driving simulation method development along several important axes. We present a series of initial scientific discoveries for the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, noting that the full scientific impact of this work has yet to be realized.ACM Reference Format Abigail Dommer1\textdagger, Lorenzo Casalino1\textdagger, Fiona Kearns1\textdagger, Mia Rosenfeld1, Nicholas Wauer1, Surl-Hee Ahn1, John Russo,2 Sofia Oliveira3, Clare Morris1, AnthonyBogetti4, AndaTrifan5,6, Alexander Brace5,7, TerraSztain1,8, Austin Clyde5,7, Heng Ma5, Chakra Chennubhotla4, Hyungro Lee9, Matteo Turilli9, Syma Khalid10, Teresa Tamayo-Mendoza11, Matthew Welborn11, Anders Christensen11, Daniel G.

      <p>We refine the OrbNet model to accurately predict energy, forces, and other response properties for molecules using a graph neural-network architecture based on features from low-cost approximated quantum operators in the symmetry-adapted atomic orbital basis. The model is end-to-end differentiable due to the derivation of analytic gradients for all electronic structure terms, and is shown to be transferable across chemical space due to the use of domain-specific features. The learning efficiency is improved by incorporating physically motivated constraints on the electronic structure through multi-task learning. The model outperforms existing methods on energy prediction tasks for the QM9 dataset and for molecular geometry optimizations on conformer datasets, at a computational cost that is thousand-fold or more reduced compared to conventional quantum-chemistry calculations (such as density functional theory) that offer similar accuracy.</p>

      <p>We introduce a machine learning method in which energy solutions from the SchrÃ¶dinger equation are predicted using symmetry adapted atomic orbital features and a graph neural-network architecture. OrbNet is shown to outperform existing methods in terms of learning efficiency and transferability for the prediction of density functional theory results while employing low-cost features that are obtained from semi-empirical electronic structure calculations. For applications to datasets of drug-like molecules, including QM7b-T, QM9, GDB-13-T, DrugBank, and the conformer benchmark dataset of Folmsbee and Hutchison [Int. J. Quantum Chem. (published online) (2020)], OrbNet predicts energies within chemical accuracy of density functional theory at a computational cost that is 1000-fold or more reduced.</p>

      <p>We confirmed that monolayer water confined by parallel graphene sheets spontaneously crystallizes from a structurally and dynamically heterogeneous liquid phase under moderate supercooling via direct molecular dynamics simulation. Square-lattice-like geometric order is observed at the early stage of nucleation and is preserved during the entire nucleus growth process. The diffusion coefficient and free energy profile in the cluster space extracted from a Bayesian trajectory analysis agree well with the classical nucleation theory (CNT) prediction and yield thermodynamic quantities exhibiting linear temperature dependence. The effectiveness of maximum cluster size as the descriptor of ice nucleation dynamics in the CNT framework can be attributed to the dynamical time scale decoupling and strong structural pattern dependence of density fluctuation in the liquid phase.</p>

      <p>We study, in this paper, the physical properties of water confined between two parallel graphene plates with different slit widths to understand the effects of confinement on the water structure and how bulk properties are reached as the water layer thickens. It was found that the microscopic structures of the interfacial liquid layer close to graphene vary with the slit width. Water tends to locate at the center of the six-membered ring of graphene planes to form triangular patterns, as found by others. The narrower the slit width is, the more pronounced this pattern is, except for the slit width of 9.5 Ã…, for which a well-defined two-layer structure of water forms. On the other hand, squared structures can be clearly seen in single snapshots at small (6.5 Ã… and 7.5 Ã…) but not large slit widths. Even at small slit widths, the square-like geometry is observed only when an average is taken for a short trajectory, and averaging over a long time yields a triangular pattern dictated by the graphene geometry. We estimate the length of time needed to observe two patterns, respectively. We also used the two-phase thermodynamic model to study the variation of entropy of confined water and found that at 8.5 Ã…, the entropy of confined water is larger than that of bulk water. The rotational entropy of confined water is higher than that of bulk water for all slit widths due to the reduction of the hydrogen bond in the confined space.</p>

      <p>The ubiquitous existence of water confined in nano-capillaries is key to fundamental biological and technological applications. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyzed the hopping-like interlayer relocation dynamics of bilayer water confined between two parallel graphene sheets. In contrary to the common scheme that relocation is driven by density fluctuations, analysis of the transition path ensemble revealed that interlayer hopping is induced by local hydrogen bond configuration fluctuations coupled with activated consecutive transient angular reorientations. Our results consolidated the anisotropic nature of water relocation under strong ordering, which provided a mechanistic insight into the relaxation behavior at glass-forming waterâ€™s fragile-to-strong crossover.</p>
