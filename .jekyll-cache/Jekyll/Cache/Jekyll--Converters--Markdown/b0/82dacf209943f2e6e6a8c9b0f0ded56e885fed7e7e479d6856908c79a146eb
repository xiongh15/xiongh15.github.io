I"k<p>I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://cce.caltech.edu/">Caltech CCE</a> working with <a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/group.html">Prof. Anima Anandkumar</a>. I collaborate closely with colleagues from the <a href="https://millergroup.caltech.edu/Miller_Group/Home.html">Miller Group</a> and <a href="https://www.entos.ai/about">Entos</a>. My research centers around developing physics-driven geometric learning approaches to tackle complex problems in chemistry and biology, especially for the study of electronic structure and dynamics out of equilibrium.</p>

<p>I earned my BSc from Peking University in 2019. As an undergraduate student I worked in the <a href="https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/gaoyq/">Gao Group</a> at <a href="https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/en/">PKU CCME</a>, where I studied the statistical mechanics of confined soft matters.</p>
