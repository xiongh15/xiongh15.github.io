I"Ì<p>Howdy! I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University. My advisor is <a href="https://www.chemeng.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1165/2600.htm">Prof. Fei Wei</a>, who leads the <a href="https://www.chemeng.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1165/2600.htm">Fluidization Lab of Tsinghua University (FLOTU)</a>. I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in chemical engineering at THU, and more recently embarked on studying advanced electron microscopy.</p>

<h6 id="research-interest"><strong><em><u>Research Interest:</u></em></strong></h6>

<p>Currently, I am working on <strong>the spatial and temporal non-periodic phenomenon</strong> in sub-nanoscale heterogeneous zeolite catalysis:</p>

<p>(1)Heterogeneous catalysis on zeolite catalysts</p>

<p>(2)In-situ imaging of zeolites and absorbed small molecules at the atomic scale</p>

<p>(3)Electron ptychography: super-resolution scanning coherent diffractive imaging of porous materials</p>
