<p>In this article, we are trying to contribute to the field of classic and massive FCC processes. By the newest multi-stage downer catalytic technique, we can transform all the heavy crude oil into worthy fundamental chemicals. This helps human society to better switch to a zero-carbon world, where fossil resources are converted into chemicals, not fuels.</p>
