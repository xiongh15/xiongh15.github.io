Our paper [Heavy oil to chemicals: multi-stage downer catalytic pyrolysis](https://hgxb.cip.com.cn/CN/10.11949/0438-1157.20221188) accepted by **CIESC Journal** is online now!:sparkles: :smile:In this article, we are trying to contribute to the field of classic and massive FCC processes. By the newest multi-stage downer catalytic technique, we can transform all the heavy crude oil into worthy fundamental chemicals.It is also the first example of my personal applying scientific discoveries to industrial applications, which I hope will be applied on a large scale in the near future.
