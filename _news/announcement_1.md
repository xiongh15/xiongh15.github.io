I have been selected as an Amazon/Caltech AI4Science Fellow of the 2020-2021 class!

The <a href="https://cms.caltech.edu/academics/honors">AI4Science Fellows program</a> is a result of a partnership between Caltech and Amazon, which recognizes graduate students and postdocs that have made remarkable impacts in AI/machine learning with scientific applications to fields beyond computer science.
