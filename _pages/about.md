Howdy! I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University. My advisor is [Prof. Fei Wei](https://www.chemeng.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1165/2600.htm), who leads the [Fluidization Lab of Tsinghua University (FLOTU)](http://www.flotu.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in chemical engineering at THU, and more recently embarked on studying advanced electron microscopy. 



###### ***<u>Research Interest:</u>***

Currently, I am working on **the spatial and temporal non-periodic phenomenon** in sub-nanoscale heterogeneous catalysis:

(1)Heterogeneous catalysis on zeolite catalysts

(2)In-situ imaging of zeolites and absorbed small molecules at the atomic scale

(3)Electron ptychography: super-resolution scanning coherent diffractive imaging of porous materials
