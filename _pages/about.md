Howdy! I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University. My advisor is [Prof. Fei Wei](https://www.chemeng.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1165/2600.htm), who leads the [Fluidization Lab of Tsinghua University (FLOTU)](https://www.chemeng.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1165/2600.htm). I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in chemical engineering at THU, and more recently embarked on studying advanced electron microscopy. 

The existence of modern human civilization mostly relies on both readily available energy, in the form of liquid fuel, and various multifunctional materials, in the form of plastics[[ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-020-00819-x)], which demand huge amounts of hydrocarbon feedstocks. There are two typical paths for producing these feedstocks, including a top-down approach that cleaves large alkane molecules into smaller molecules and a bottom-up approach that small molecules such as CO~2~, CO, and methanol are assembled into larger molecules. Their core feature is the need to use the acidic catalytic and shape-selective capabilities of zeolites with regular nanopore systems to control product molecules in specific sizes and configurations. Here, we are trying to expand the horizons of current research in the field of zeolite by breaking through the spatial limited resolution to gain increased mechanistic insights into the structure and chemistry of these systems.

###### ***<u>Research Interest:</u>***

Currently, I am working on **the spatial and temporal non-periodic phenomenon** in sub-nanoscale heterogeneous zeolite catalysis:

(1)Heterogeneous catalysis on zeolite catalysts

(2)In-situ imaging of zeolites and absorbed small molecules at the atomic scale

(3)Electron ptychography: super-resolution scanning coherent diffractive imaging of porous materials
