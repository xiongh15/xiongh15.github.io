This is Hao Xiong's personal homepage.

## Introduction 

My name is Hao Xiong, and I am a Ph.D. candidate supervised by [Prof. Fei Wei](https://www.chemeng.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1094/2395.htm) at Tsinghua University(THU,清华大学), starting in 2019. I obtained my bachelor's degree in chemical engineering at THU, and more recently embarked on studying advanced electron microscopy.  Currently, I am working on the spatial and temporal non-periodic phenomenon in sub-nanoscale heterogeneous catalysis. 



## Research interest:

- Heterogeneous catalysis on zeolite catalysts

- In-situ imaging of zeolites and absorbed small molecules at the atomic scale

- Electron ptychography: super-resolution scanning coherent diffractive imaging of porous materials
